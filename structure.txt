Questions: 
	1. When two green agents interact with each other, would/how do they affect each other
	2. how many agents does blue affect at once
	3. "followers lost(fixed)" or "risk(percentage)" with red propaganda


Green class:
	1. Initialization:
		a. Uncertainty: randomised between -1.0  to 1.0
        b. Opinion: randomised between "for voting"(-1.0) and "against voting"(1.0)

	2. Talking to neighbouring green node:
        ???


Red class (player):
    variables:
        risk = how likely uncertainty will decrease (agent more likely to vote)
        effectiveness = how likely uncertainty will increase (agent less likely to vote)
        potency = how much uncertainty will increase 

    1. Level 1 propaganda -
        interact: uncertainty 0.8 and below
		    potency:0.05
    2. Level 2 propaganda -
        interact: uncertainty 0.6 and below
        potency:0.1
    3. Level 3 propaganda -
        interact: uncertainty 0.4 and below
        potency:0.15
    4. Level 4 propaganda -
        interact: uncertainty 0.2 and below
        potency:0.2
    5. Level 5 propaganda -
        interact: uncertainty below 0
        potency:0.25

Blue class (player):
    max energy = 50
    should only interact with agents with lower uncertainties 
    occasionally dispatches gray agent

    variables:
        potency = how much uncertainty will decrease
        energy cost = amount of energy lost per interaction

    1. Level 1 counter-propaganda -
		potency = 0.05
        energy cost = 1
    2. Level 2 counter-propaganda -
	    potency = 0.1
        energy cost = 2
    3. Level 3 counter-propaganda -
	    potency = 0.15
        energy cost = 3
    4. Level 4 counter-propaganda -
	    potency = 0.2
        energy cost = 4
    5. Level 5 counter-propaganda -
		potency = 0.25 
        energy cost = 5 

Gray class:
    1. Initialization: affiliation: red or blue (randomised - 50/50??)
    2. mimics actions of team it is affiliated with (but without consequence)
    3. messages sent out would have randomised potencies
